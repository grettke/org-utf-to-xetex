* Introduction

Nice to meet you ðŸ˜„.

Wherever we end up going from here:

Thank you for spending your precious time and valued brainpowerâ€”it is truly
appreciated!

This contribution guide exists so that you and other contributor will get
the most out of your effort for the least time and expenditure required. It is
simpleâ€”we are looking for all and everything you view as a contribution.

* Areas To Contribute

- Improving documentation.
- Bug triage.
- Writing tutorials.
- Feature ideas.
- "Simple things" like spelling and grammar fixes, typo correction, white
  space and formatting changes, and comment clean.
- Refactoring.
- Support questionsâ€¦ Yes really! If you are facing it then you can't be the
  only one. It is an opportunity to better the documentation, the package
  itself, or more.
- Whatever things that /aren't/ listed here that /should be/.

* Contribution Expectations

- Coding style and conventions :: The Emacs Lisp code should follow the
     [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tips.html][Emacs Lisp conventions]] and the [[https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-lisp-style-guide][Emacs Lisp Style Guide]].
- Grammar and Language :: Use a spell-checker like [[http://aspell.net/][Aspell]] and grammar-checker
     like [[https://languagetool.org/][LanguageTool]] for your docstrings and documentation. Find writing
     problems like weasel-words, passive-voice and duplicate words with
     [[https://github.com/bnbeckwith/writegood-mode][Writegood Mode]]
- Use quality-checking tools :: Use [[https://melpa.org/#/flycheck][flycheck]], [[https://github.com/purcell/package-lint][package-lint]] and
     [[https://github.com/purcell/flycheck-package][flycheck-package]] to help you identify common errors in package metadata
     and code. Use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tips.html][checkdoc]] to make sure that your package
     follows the conventions for documentation strings.
- *Review existing issues* :: [[https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog/issues][The issue tracker]] may already have them solved,
     otherwise they are a great place to start
- *The Future* :: [[https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog/FUTURE.org][The future file]] may already have new features listed, and if it doesn't then maybe it should. Either way it might be a great place to start.
- *Accept the license* :: Org2Blog is licensed [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html][GPLv3]]: you understand and submit
     your code under those terms.

* Conclusion

That is it. That is everything. If you made it this far then kudos for you to
